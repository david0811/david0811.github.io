::: {#hero-heading}

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Climate, Meteorology, and Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. My advisor is [Professor Ryan Sriver](https://rsriver.web.illinois.edu/).

My work seeks to understand the uncertainties surrounding projections of future climate and the associated risks of climate change. I have an M.Sc. from Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg and a B.Sc. from the University of Glasgow.
