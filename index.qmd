::: {#hero-heading}

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering](https://cals.cornell.edu/biological-environmental-engineering) at Cornell University, working with [Professor Vivek Srikrishnan](https://viveks.me/). I work on climate risk management and seek to understand how we can improve societal resilience to climate change in the presence of deep and dynamic uncertainties. 

I completed my Ph.D. in the [Department of Climate, Meteorology, and Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, under [Professor Ryan Sriver](https://rsriver.web.illinois.edu/). I have an M.Sc. from Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg and a B.Sc. from the University of Glasgow.
