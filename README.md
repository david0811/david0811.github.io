This is my personal/academic website, hosted by Github at [david0811.github.io](https://david0811.github.io) and powered by Jekyll.

Thanks to [Steven Miller](http://svmiller.github.io) for providing this theme, and to the lab websites of [Vivek Srikrishnan](https://viveks.bee.cornell.edu/) and [James Doss-Gollin](https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/) for some code and ideas.
