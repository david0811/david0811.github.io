I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell University, working with Professor Vivek Srikrishnan.

I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Climate, Meteorology, and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign under Professor Ryan Sriver. I have an M.Sc. from Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg and a B.Sc. from the University of Glasgow.

Outside of work, I enjoy running and cycling, playing and watching football soccer, and pretending to be a coffee aficionado.
