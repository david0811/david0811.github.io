<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://atmos.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Atmospheric Sciences</a>
at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</a> My advisor is
<a href="https://atmos.illinois.edu/directory/profile/rsriver" target="_blank">Professor Ryan Sriver.</a></p>

<p>My research focuses on understanding how well we can simulate climate and weather extremes and their impacts on coupled human-environment systems such as agriculture.
  More broadly, I am interested in applying the frameworks of multi-sector dynamics and decision-making under uncertainty to the problem of climate change adaptation.</p>

<p>Prior to joining the University of Illinois, I earned an M.Sc. from
 <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en" target="_blank">Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg</a>
  and before that, a B.Sc. from the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I enjoy running, playing and watching <s>football</s> soccer, pretending to be a coffee aficionado,
  and baking sourdough bread.</p>
