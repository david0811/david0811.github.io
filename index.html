  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the <a href="https://atmos.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Atmospheric
      Sciences</a>
    at the <a href="https://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</a> My advisor is
    <a href="https://atmos.illinois.edu/directory/profile/rsriver" target="_blank">Professor Ryan Sriver.</a>
  </p>

  <p>My research seeks to better understand the uncertainties surrounding projections of future climate and the
    associated risks of climate change. I am particularly interested in the challenges of generating local-scale
  climate information, and how we can ensure that adaptation decisions are robust to the full range of possible climate futures.</p>

  <p>Prior to joining the University of Illinois, I earned an M.Sc. from
    <a href="https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en" target="_blank">Ruprecht-Karls-Universit√§t Heidelberg</a>
    and before that, a B.Sc. from the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a>.
  </p>

  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy running and cycling, playing and watching <s>football</s> soccer, and pretending to be a
    coffee aficionado.</p>
